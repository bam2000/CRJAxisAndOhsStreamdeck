Aerosoft CRJ 700 Streamdeck and Axis and Ohs Scripts

This are my Scripts for the Aerosoft CRJ 700/550 and maybe also 900/1000 These Scripts and Templates are working for the following Hardware

    Behringer X-Touch Mini
    Emuteq GNS53
    Elgato StreamDeck XL
    Honeycomb Alpha Yoke
    Honeycomb Bravo Throttle
    Saitek/Logitech Radio Panel

Special Thanks for Oliver and the great Axis and Ohs Tool and especially for answering all my questions and giving hints on possible solutions :)

Also Thanks CaptOle, FltsimFlyboy and Guenseli from flightsim.to for some amazing scripts and templates i could use to create this :)

I know this Setup is very special, but maybe you can edit your own creation with it.

<b>Installation</b>

Import the CRJ AAO Scripts into AAO using the "CRJ_AxisAndOhsScripts.xml" (scripting --> import scripts)

Import the StreamDeck profile for the CRJ (double click on "CRJ.streamDeckProfile")
